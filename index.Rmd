# Sarah Strochak

I'm currently a PhD student in Public Policy at NYU Wagner, and a doctoral fellow at the Furman Center.

My research is at the intersection of urban economics, public economics, and housing policy. My current work studies the Housing Choice Voucher program, including measuring program take-up, evaluating policy changes, and identifying how the program contributes to economic mobility. 

Before coming to NYU, I worked as a researcher at the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute, researching the mortgage market, access to credit, and land use policy.

More about my research can be found here [here](https://sstrochak.github.io/research.html). My CV is [here](cv_files/Sarah_Strochak_CV_Sep2023.pdf).
